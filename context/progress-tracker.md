## Decisions Made During Intake

- **Language:** Python 3.12 (user environment; LangGraph-first ecosystem).
- **Verdict:** workflow, not agent — fixed 5-stage pipeline with Send fan-out only for verification (ADR-001). Agency L0–L1.
- **VLM access:** OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`VLM_BASE_URL`/`VLM_API_KEY`/`VLM_MODEL`, default qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct) — user choice; works with vLLM/ollama/OpenRouter/DashScope-compatible.
- **Checkpointer:** SqliteSaver (user choice) — single-run-at-a-time acceptable for prototype; Postgres deferred.
- **Input data:** user adds real bus videos to `data/inbox/`; no synthetic video generator shipped. Tests use tiny cv2-written fixture clips instead.
- **Prototype flag:** HARDEN stage skipped — `prototype: no harden stage` (user decision, AGENTS.md §4). Eval scaffold (Phase 4) still built.
- **Git:** local only for now; user will create the GitHub repo and push when ready.
- **Report:** markdown auto-report per run (user choice); CSV/PDF exports out of scope.
- **Stub-model mode:** `ROADFIX_STUB_MODELS=1` — deterministic detectors/verdicts so tests and no-GPU demos run without weights or endpoints. Real-model runs are documented operator procedures.
- **HITL:** zero interrupts in v1 — deterministic confidence gate is cheap and reversible (ADR-001).
- **Package name:** `roadfix` under `src/roadfix/`; repo SIH2026-PROTOTYPE carries the full AI-SYSTEMS workflow assets (AGENTS.md, skills/, context-references/) so the project is self-contained.
